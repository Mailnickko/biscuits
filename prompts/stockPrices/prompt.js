/*
 * Suppose we could access yesterday's stock prices as an array, where the indices are the time in minutes past opening time (9.30am local time)
 * and the values are the price (in dollars) of a company's stock at that time.
 * 
 * Write a function that takes an array of stock prices and returns the best profit that could have been made from
 * 1 purchase and 1 sale of the company stock. 
 * 
 * You do not have any stock in the company beforehand - so you must buy 1 stock before you sell.
 * You may not buy and sell in the same step (that is, 1 minute must pass between each 'action').
