/*
 * You have a collection of N wines placed next to each other on a shelf. Wines get better every year,
 * so the price of a particular wine is multipled by how old it is relative to the current year. 
 * (i.e Wine A is priced at 4 during the current year. Next year, it will be priced at 4 * 2);
 * 
 * You want to sell all the wines you have, but you can only sell ONE wine per year, starting on this year.
 * You can also only sell the leftmost wine on the shelf or the rightmost wine on the shelf at any given point.
 * You are not allowed to reorder the wines.
 *
 * Write a function that returns the maximum profit you can get if you sell the wines in optimal order.
 *
 * E.g
 * var winesOnShelf = [2, 3, 5, 1, 4];
 *
 * maxProfitFromWine(winesOnShelf); // 50
 * // The optimal order in this case is: 
 * // wine1, wine5, wine4, wine2, wine3
 * // 2*1 + 4*2 + 1*3 + 3*4 + 5*5 = 50
 *
